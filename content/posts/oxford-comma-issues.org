During recent work, we have encountered an interesting concept called [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Oxford_comma][Oxford
comma]] (also called a Harvard comma, or a serial comma, or series comma). As a
native Chinese speaker, I have neither met it nor expected it ever before. There
are already enough other aspects that are of inherent ambiguity and implicitness
of my native language (or any other natural language), but the Oxford comma is
definitely a problem for languages that are not written in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scriptio_continua][scriptio continua]].

#+caption: Oxford Comma

An Oxford comma is a comma placed immediately before the
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_conjunction#Coordinating_conjunctions][coordinating
conjunction]] (usually /and/ or /or/) in a series of three or more terms[fn:1].
For example, a list of three items may be punctuated either as *x, y and z* or
*x, y, and z*. Thus in the latter sentence, the last comma before /and/ ([[http://universaldependencies.org/en/dep/conj.html][conj]])
is the Oxford comma.

* Usage and Style Guides

Whether to use the Oxford comma or not is totally a stylistic choice, which
means it is absolutely up to the authors. However, if you are drafting materials
for, e.g. academic purposes, you might want to know if there is any guide
specifically discussing the usage of the Oxford comma. Please read carefully
through the sections of /[[file:Recommendations%20by%20style%20guides][Usage]]/ and /[[file:Recommendations%20by%20style%20guides][Recommendations by style guides]]/ from its
Wikipedia page for more information.

* Ambiguity
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: ambiguity
:END:
Resolving the ambiguity is a classic and intriguing task for computational
linguists or people from the NLP community. Usually, ambiguities can arise from
the uses of compound nouns, [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/endophora][endophoras]] or just missing information regarding
contexts. However, the use of Oxford commas may also either resolve or bring
ambiguities. We will soon see it is actually a logic problem and the very
"fragility" of our natural language.

** Resolving Ambiguity

Consider this common example that looks from a book's dedication:

#+begin_quote
To my parents, David and Humpty Dumpty.

#+end_quote

Without the Oxford comma, the sentence above could be interpreted as stating
that this book is dedicated to your parents who are David and Humpty Dumpty. If
we put an Oxford comma in the right place:

#+begin_quote
To my parents, David, and Humpty Dumpty.

#+end_quote

It removes the ambiguity such that "my parents", "David" and "Humpty Dumpty" are
three isolated items thus no confusion anymore.

** Creating Ambiguity
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: creating-ambiguity
:END:
Interestingly, consider an example that looks from a book's dedication:

#+begin_quote
To my father, David, and Humpty Dumpty.

#+end_quote

In this case, the second item "David" will create the ambiguity such that it can
mean "father" or just "David". The subtlety here is "David" can be an appositive
referring to "father" so that the sentence actually only contains two unique
items instead of three. If we remove the Oxford comma:

#+begin_quote
To my father, David and Humpty Dumpty.

#+end_quote

then the ambiguity will be removed as well, since "David" here cannot be read as
in apposition to "father" anymore.

** Irreconcilable Ambiguity
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: irreconcilable-ambiguity
:END:
Finally, we will introduce a somewhat pessimistic situation here. That
is, sometimes, it seems the ambiguity just cannot be harmonised.
Consider this example:

#+begin_quote
To my mom and aunt, Maria and Sophia.

#+end_quote

It is ambiguous because we cannot determine how many people are there indeed.
"Maria and Sophia" can be in apposition to "mom and aunt" as an entirety. So
there can be either four people mentioned or just two. However, even if we add
up an Oxford comma:

#+begin_quote
To my mom and aunt, Maria, and Sophia.

#+end_quote

still, the ambiguity remains. In this case, "Maria" can be an appositive
referring to "aunt". So we will be wondering if it's mentioning four people or
three instead.

This is rather embarrassing. For both authors and readers, we need to be aware
of this phenomenon. On the other hand, there are of course many ways to remove
those ambiguities --- by rewriting the sentence into another form. Even further,
its Wikipedia page even records a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma#In_general][list]] of general rules for avoiding creating
ambiguities[1]:

- The list *x*, *y* and *z* is unambiguous if *y* and *z* cannot be read as in
  apposition to *x*.
- Equally, *x*, *y*, and *z* is unambiguous if *y* cannot be read as in
  apposition to *x*.
- If neither *y* nor *y*[,] and *z* can be read as in apposition to *x*, then
  both forms of the list are unambiguous; but if both *y* and *y* and *z* can be
  read as in apposition to *x*, then both forms of the list are ambiguous.
- *x* and *y* and *z* is unambiguous if *x* and *y* and *y* and *z* cannot both
  be grouped.

Those strategic rules are the reason why we considered it is actually "a logic
problem" at the beginning of this section. I am curious how computer algorithms
resolve this type of ambiguity brought by the usage of Oxford comma, although
humans can justify the logic and rewrite the sentences into right forms.
