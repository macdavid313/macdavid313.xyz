*Model M* designates a group of computer keyboards designed and manufactured by
 IBM starting in 1984, and later by Lexmark International, Maxi Switch, and
 Unicomp. The keyboard's many variations have their own distinct
 characteristics, with the vast majority having a buckling-spring key design and
 swappable keycaps. Model M keyboards have been praised by computer enthusiasts
 and frequent typists due to their durability and consistency, and the tactile
 and auditory feedback they provide.

键盘的成色挺不错，敲击感非常好，敲打声很大。我用了一小会儿后，周围的同事都"不约而同"地戴起了降噪耳机。
